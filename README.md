> Smart move, Amy. I've been called the Leonardo da Vinci of sitting on my ass. - *Norm Scully, Brooklyn 99*

*Public benches* and seating broadly is a *crucial public infrastructure*.  
Unfortunately, because it doesn't generate revenue and can't be sold with subscription model, it doesn't align with capitalist catch-up we have going out there, and so we are slowly being robbed out of our seating spaces.  
This is an attempt to document public spaces, and hopefully we can use what spaces we do have to ask more seating of the powers that be.  

reach out to me at *airbendingseneca* on instagram to see how you can help.
